 Standalone Python 3.7.13 for windows!
 
 Python 3.7.13 standalone is specific to use on certain versions of Houdini. Almost all Houdini versions use 3.7.4 which can be downloaded from the official but for some versions they use version 3.7.13 which is not available on the official Python site so I made this specifically for Windows users, especially Houdini users who want to install version 3.7.13. by installing this special version you can easily develop your own software or can run some python commands on houdini.

Just Copy and Paste it to, For example C:\Program Files\Python37 (Copy inside Python X.X.XX repository)
